Creating a new blog
===================

blohg will install a script called ``blohg`` for you. This script is capable to
create a new Mercurial repository for you, using the default template and/or
run the development server. It will be your main tool to interact with blohg.


Initializing the repository
---------------------------

To create a new repository, type::
    
    $ blohg initrepo --repo-path my_blohg

Where ``my_blohg`` is the directory where the template will be installed.

Make sure that the directory doesn't exists, or is empty, before try to
initialize the repository.
